##Project assumptions. Diploma theses - project context
At some university (if not all), a student must complete a certain stage of education complete and defend a final thesis called a diploma thesis. The diploma thesis is carried out at the end of each stage of studies. So graduate theses are written by students of studies undergraduate, engineering and graduate. In the future, the university plans to expand its offer for new types of studies, which will also end with a diploma thesis. Each student, in addition to the first and last name, has a unique identifier at the university in the form of an index number. The index number is a sequence of 10 characters and uniquely identifies a student studying at the university.
 
 A student who wants to complete a given type of study must choose the topic of the diploma thesis. The thesis topic of the work is of course related to its supervisor, usually called the job promoter. The rule is that one topic is managed by one supervisor - a university employee degree of doctor, habilitated doctor, or professor.

The university authorities encourage their students to write individual essays. But they also allow two or three students to complete their work. More people cannot write one diploma thesis.

After writing, the work is reviewed. The review is performed by one or more university employees and evaluated. Each reviewer can rate the work on a scale of 2 to 5.

The work is also evaluated by the supervisor.

To the topic are assigned predefined words. These are the so-called keywords that allow you to assign the topic of work to a specific area and then find work related to a similar topic. The keywords can be: computer science, operating systems, reinforced concrete structures, etc. Each job should have at least one keyword assigned to it.

After writing the thesis, the student starts the defense of the thesis. This defense takes place on a designated day and ends with the issuance of a final diploma thesis, the final grade.

The university would like to improve the handling of diploma theses and related processes. Therefore, it plans to develop an IT system supporting the operation of these processes. The first stage of work is to build a database that will meet the following
requirements:

1. It will make it possible to store information about defended diploma theses of all university students

2. It will enable quick and easy search for works related to a given topic or supervised by a specific promoter.

3. It will allow creating reports of theses
• reviewed by university staff
• defended on a given day, month, year
• defended in a given type of studies
